			<h1>Welcome to ConsoleLogLife</h1>

			<Code id="console" code={`console.log("Hello World, Hello Life");`} lang="js" theme="dark-plus"/>

			<p>
				Ever wondered what happens when you try debugging life while learning to code? Welcome to 
				ConsoleLogLife, where personal growth meets programming challenges, and life transformations 
				are documented in verbose mode.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here, you'll find raw, unfiltered stories about navigating career shifts, embracing major life 
				changes, and the beautiful chaos of learning to code while adulting. No sanitized success stories, 
				just honest logs of failures, victories, and the orange Tic Tac-fueled moments in between.
			</p>
			<p>What to expect:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Late-night coding adventures and their surprising life lessons</li>
				<li>Real talk about career transitions and starting over</li>
				<li>Stories about taking calculated risks and making life-changing decisions</li>
				<li>Technical struggles and breakthroughs</li>
				<li>The human side of professional transformation</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				This isn't your typical tech blog or lifestyle journal â€“ it's a debug console for life's 
				compilation errors and runtime exceptions. Whether you're contemplating a similar journey 
				or just curious about someone else's process, you're welcome to explore these logs.
			</p>
