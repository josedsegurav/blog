        Hi!, my name is <strong>Jose</strong>, welcome to my personal blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, you'll find raw, unfiltered stories about navigating career
        shifts, embracing major life changes, and the beautiful chaos of
        learning to code while adulting. No sanitized success stories, just
        honest logs of failures, victories, and the orange Tic Tac-fueled
        moments in between.
      </p>

      <p>
        I come from a diverse background. I've worked in sales and customer
        service, owned a music studio where I recorded, mixed, and mastered
        tracks, and even handled audio engineering for live shows and events. My
        wife and I also ran a delivery business for a couple of years, which
        helped us through the pandemic.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've always been passionate about technology and understanding how
        things work. I once "Frankensteined" a bass guitar by experimenting with
        pickup changes (it was a small project, really!), and I built my own PC
        from scratch, meticulously researching components and compatibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        This blog is a space where I share my journeyâ€”the ups, downs, lessons,
        experiences, and plenty of struggles. I want to track my growth and,
        hopefully, create a record my family can be proud of.
      </p>

    pursueLife();

    console.log("The journey continues... ðŸŒŸ");
