You know that mixture of excitement and nervousness you get before opening a gift? That's exactly how I felt stepping off the plane into our new city. Everything was wrapped in possibility, though I had no idea what to expect once we started unwrapping this new life we'd chosen.

Our first home was a downtown Airbnb with views that belonged on a postcard. The weather welcomed us gently – not the blast of heat we'd prepared ourselves for, but something kinder, like the city was trying to ease us in. Though I have to say, downtown life came with its own reality checks. Seeing so many homeless people on our daily walks was sobering, a stark reminder that every city has its challenges and stories that need telling.

If there's one thing that makes a new city feel less strange, it's having friends already settled in. We hit the friend lottery here – they've been our living, breathing guidebook, helping us navigate everything from grocery shopping to hauling our ridiculously heavy suitcases. Every "Oh, you should try this place!" and "Let me show you how this works" has been worth its weight in gold. I'm not sure what we did to deserve such amazing friends, but I'm grateful for every moment they've spent helping us find our feet.

House hunting turned out to be its own adventure. Try finding an apartment that checks all these boxes: must love dogs, perfect location, available right now, and matches our somewhat particular taste. It's like trying to find the perfect pair of jeans, except the jeans cost thousands of dollars and you have to live in them. We walked so many neighborhoods that our feet probably deserve their own thank-you note. But hey, at least we got to know the city intimately, one blistered toe at a time.

Our dog has been the unexpected star of this whole transition. Watching her discover city life has been better than any reality show. Every new smell is breaking news, every passing dog a potential best friend, and every squirrel apparently a personal challenge to her dignity. She's adapting to city life with the kind of enthusiasm only dogs can muster, though I'm pretty sure she's still confused about why these squirrels seem braver than the ones back home.

Starting college felt like opening a new chapter in a book – everything fresh and full of possibility, slightly daunting but exciting. The people I've met so far seem to be on similar journeys, each with their own story of how they ended up here, making every conversation feel like discovering a new favorite song.

Surprisingly, we haven't been as homesick as we expected. Maybe we're still riding the wave of newness, or maybe we're just too busy figuring out which grocery store has the best prices to notice. I know it'll hit eventually – probably when I least expect it – but for now, I'm grateful for this honeymoon period with our new city.

As I write this, I'm looking out at a skyline that's starting to feel familiar. There's still so much to figure out, so many corners of the city to explore, and probably a thousand more times our dog will try to chase those surprisingly confident squirrels. But for now, everything feels exactly where it should be – under construction, but with a solid foundation.
