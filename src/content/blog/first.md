You know that moment when you're lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, and suddenly realize your life has become a perfectly orchestrated routine? That's exactly where I found myself not too long ago.

Don't get me wrong – I've checked all the boxes in life's grand to-do list. University degree? Check. Stable job? Check. Marriage to the most amazing person who still makes my heart skip a beat? Double check. We even managed to snag our own little corner of the world, complete with a mortgage that loves to remind us of its existence every month.

But here's the thing about routines: they have a sneaky way of turning into ruts. The same office, the same desk, the same spreadsheets day after day. The numbers in my bank account played an endless game of musical chairs – up with payday, down with bills, repeat. It wasn't bad, just... predictable.

Then 2020 rolled around with its plot twist of the century. COVID-19 burst onto the scene like an uninvited guest who overstays their welcome. Suddenly, my carefully balanced financial juggling act needed a few more balls in the air. Fun times, right?
But you know what they say about pressure creating diamonds? Well, I'm not claiming to be a diamond, but something definitely crystallized during those long hours stuck at home. Between Netflix marathons and discovering my complete inability to bake bread, I stumbled upon web development tutorials.

Have you ever fallen down a rabbit hole so fascinating that 3 AM catches you by surprise? That's what happened. Udemy became my new best friend. My laptop's brightness was the only light in the room as I battled with code into the wee hours. HTML, CSS, JavaScript – they became my midnight companions.

Some nights were amazing – I'd build something that actually worked, and I'd feel like a tech genius. Other nights? Well, let's just say my Google searches got increasingly desperate: "Why is my code not working?" "Is web development supposed to be this hard?" "Can you survive on orange Tic Tacs alone?"

Progress felt like watching paint dry while riding a roller coaster – somehow both frustratingly slow and terrifyingly fast. Each small victory was celebrated with a silent fist pump (because everyone else was asleep), and each error message felt like a personal insult.
And then, somewhere between "Hello World" and actually building functional websites, a crazy idea took root. Why not take this show on the road? Like, literally to a different country? The thought was equal parts exciting and terrifying – kind of like that first time you deploy code to production.

So here I am, standing at the edge of something new. My comfortable routine is about to get a major update, and for the first time in a while, I'm actually excited about the bugs in my life's program. They're not errors anymore; they're features leading me somewhere new.
To be continued... (hopefully with fewer coffee-fueled coding sessions and more success stories)
