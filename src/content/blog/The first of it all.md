We're now ten months into our journey in Winnipeg, Canada, a period filled with emotions, challenges, and significant changes. It's been tough, especially being far from loved ones, but we've received immense support from friends, and the city itself has been welcoming. I must admit, though, winter here is incredibly long and intensely cold!

I'm currently enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development program at Red River College, and my wife is working in a field closely related to her experience in Ecuador. And, of course, our puppy Akira joined us on this adventure.

## Why Web Development?

When I was managing my music studio and building my online presence, I realized I needed a website. I built it using WordPress ([you can see it here](https://2espiral.wordpress.com/)), and honestly, it wasn't as challenging as I expectedâ€”mostly drag-and-drop. While it initially looked great, it soon lacked personality and was difficult to make truly unique with the basic setup. Still, it served its purpose at the time, but it left me with a growing curiosity about building more styled and personalized websites.

Then COVID-19 hit. The world plunged into chaos with widespread layoffs, and the airline industry, where I was working, offered little hope. Amidst all the uncertainty, I decided to dive into web development. I joined a short Full Stack program, thinking, "Why not aim for a high-paying, remote job?" It was tough! HTML and CSS were straightforward, but JavaScript, PHP (Laravel), Node, Postman, Axios... ðŸ˜¶ Looking back at those lines of code, it's clear I struggled immensely.

```
import axios from "axios"
    const instance = axios.create({
 baseURL: 'https://laravel-api-josesegura.herokuapp.com/'
})
const sendEmail = async (data) => {
 const response = await instance({
   method: 'post',
   url: 'contact/store',
   data: data
 });
 return response
};
export {
 sendEmail
}
```
And that's how my web development journey began. I love to create, and it's even more interesting when I can combine it with other passions like music, photography, and games. At the same time, it feels like there's an endless amount to learn, requiring constant learning and practice.
